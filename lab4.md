Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a licesnse to choose a license as it ensures your audience that it follows the Open Source Definition. It makes people feel protected using the product so that it doesn't stop being usable as they would like.

Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

It is important to not use a project that doesn't as explicit license because you would not be sure that it is actually open source. It can lead to legal issues or changes in the future that stop you from using the software openly.

Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
Do you agree with this claim? Write two to five sentences.

Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).

Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal.	

GPL lets one change, modify and copy as long as they track changes, and include build and install instructions. LGPL is similar but doesn't have to show how to build and install, but rather allow reverse engineering to do so. Apache/BSD allow complete freedom outside of including copyright notices. For A company, GPL is best as it gives instructions on how to use the code for users, allows patents and commercial use and distribute. For developers, LGPL is best as it allows them to distribute but not patent to stop progress and reverse engineering might not be accessible to others. For the common good, Apache/BSD is best as it allows them to do what with the code being the most open.
